# Hero Emergency App Backend
My graduation project was a first aid application called Hero.

Hero contains various features as:
* Clear step-by-step instructions for medical, pet and home emergency cases using video, audio and text.
* User can search via text or voice using case name or common symptoms or synonyms to find the emergency case in English or Arabic.
* A button to show all the emergency numbers. User can add a contact to the emergency numbers and call direct from the app.
* A button to locate nearest hospitals or nearest vets based on user's current location.
* User can chat with chatbot via text ot voice(Speech-To-Text) to identify the emergency case and provide the appropriate steps. Chatbot response also can be in the form of text or voice(TTS).
